# Aken Ajalukku - Android application
The Android application is the end user facing application. The purpose of the Android application is to allow the user
to see points of interest (PoIs) on a map, navigate to them and view more details about them when close enough to their location.

It should communicate to the backend CMS through an API in order to get a list of PoIs. This allows the administrators
to change the available PoIs without having to update the application itself.
