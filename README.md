Aken Ajalukku is an Android application targeted at tourists and/or students.

The application helps tourists experience historic events in 90â€™s Estonia by showing information and 
videos at pre-determined historic locations in Tallinn and Tartu. The videos are all shot in these locations and 
therefore the user can relive the historic event.
