Aken Ajalukku is an Android application targeted at tourists and/or students.

The application helps tourists experience historic events in 90â€™s Estonia by showing information and 
videos at pre-determined historic locations in Tallinn and Tartu. The videos are all shot in these locations and 
therefore the user can relive the historic event.

# Project structure
The project is split into two main folders. **App** contains the code for the Android application. **CMS** has the code for the
back-end content management and API.

For more information about each sub-project, see their respective readmes.
